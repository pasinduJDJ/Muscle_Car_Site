            <h3><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>What is the meaning of muscle car?</h3> 
            <p>Muscle car is a description used for a high-performance American 
               car, by some definitions an intermediate sized car fitted with a 
               large displacement V8 engine. Historically they were all rear-wheel
               drive, but that changed with technological advances.</p>

          <div class="what-is-2">
            
            <h3><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>What is the fastest muscle car ever?</h3>
            <p>Finally, the Challenger SRT hellcat tops the list. It is known as 
                the most incredible muscle car and fastest muscle car ever produced. 
                It has an incredible 707 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque.</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>Whats faster a Camaro or Mustang?</h3>
            <p>As tested by Motor Trend, the Chevy Camaro is faster than the Ford 
                Mustang at every level and every distance. Their racecourse test 
                saw the Chevrolet Camaro SS Coupe get clocked a full 3.3 seconds 
                faster than the Ford Mustang GT Premium Fastback (80.67 to 83.97 
                seconds)</p>

              as a 1965 model,while post-August cars are "late" 1965s. The 
              Mustang launched with convertible and notchback body styles, 
              with the fastback joining the lineup as a late 
              '65. A plethora of options enabled buyers to configure their Mustang 
               as anything from an economical runabout to a weekend race car.
              <br>
              <br>
              The original engine lineup consisted of a 170-cid straight-six, 
              4.3-liter V-8, and the legendary 289-cid V-8 with up to 271 horsepower. 
              For late '65, the six was enlarged to 200 cid (3.3 liters) and the 260 
              was replaced by a 289 with a two-barrel carburetor. The Mustang roared 
              into 1966 with only minor changes, and on March 1 of that year, Ford 
              built the millionth Mustang.</p>

              to release it in 1970. The initial idea was for Challenger to have a 
              turbine engine, but the designers decided to leave it out. However, they 
              liked the sketches, so Dodge took it as an inspiration for their final 
              product. The first generation of Challenger was created by using the 
              Chrysler E platform.

             <br>
             The buyers were initially able to choose between a two-door hardtop coupe 
             or a convertible. There were two options for engines as well - an Inline-6 
             or V8 engine. The selection of engines was remarkable for that time. They 
             ranged from a 225-cubic-inch I-6 with 145 horsepower to a 440-cubic-inch 
             V-8 with 390 horsepower.</p>

        <div class="box-1">
         <p>The 1960’s was the golden age of the muscle car. The decade started 
           with cars build specifically for the drag racing crowd. The compact 
           Dodge Dart was fitted with a 413ci Max Wedge engine and promptly 
           dominated the strip. Ford created the Thunderbolt from a stripped 
           down Fairlane. With its fiberglass body boards and its lack of all 
           comfort features, it was a real barn burner. Quarter mile times of 
           less than twelve seconds were common. Ford also offered 200 copies 
           of a stripped down version of the Galaxies with a 427 cubic inch 
           engine. This was the same engine powering the Thunderbolt. These 
           were very limited production models and only a few copies were 
           sold. The only muscle car offered to the masses during the early 
           part of the decade was the Impala Super Sport with a 409ci engine.
          
          <br>
          <br>In 2005 Ford redesigned the Mustang and for the third time, the
           Mustang changed the automotive landscape. Sales exploded and people 
           loved the retro look. At the same time, Chrysler developed a new line 
           of rear wheel drive intermediates and the Charger with an optional 
           HEMI engine was born. The muscle car was back. Dodge followed up the 
           Charger with a retro Challenger and Chevrolet is racing to re-introduce 
           a classic Camaro.  The muscle car is back.
          </p>

        <div class="box-2">
           <p>The flood gates opened in 1964 with the introduction of the 
             Pontiac GTO. The GTO was the first of the classic muscle cars. 
             It was an intermediate sized car and it came with a 389ci engine. 
             Performance was very acceptable with 0-60 time of 7.7 seconds 
             and a ¼ mile time of 15.8 seconds. However, performance was only 
             part of the success of the GTO. The secret to the GTO’s success was
              three fold. The looks were right, the performance was right and the
               performance was right. These three factors launched many muscle cars
                over the next few years.
              <br>
              <br>
              Ford’s competitors raced furiously to introduce pony cars of their 
              own. Plymouth quickly launched the Barracuda and even beat the 
              Mustang to market. By 1967 GM introduced the Camaro and the Firebird. 
              The next year AMC launched the AMX and the Javelin.</p>

        <div class="box-3">
          <p>The 1970’s started out well enough. Many consider 1970 as the pinnacle 
            year for classic muscle cars.  Then the world changed, fuel prices began 
            to rise, the insurance companies started raising rates and the economy 
            began to slow down. By 1974 all the original muscle cars were just shadows 
            of their former selves.  Performance was no longer a consideration for the 
            automotive customer was looking for fuel economy, not tire burning 
            performance. The Mustang was neutered, the ‘Cuda and Challenger were
             discontinued. The Chargers and Chevelles were now mid-priced luxury cars. 
             The only cars to continue the tradition were the Firebird and the Camaro. 
             Although, they too were much less powerful than they’d been just a 
             few years earlier.
            <br>
            <br>
            Nothing much happened until the Ford Mustang was reintroduced in 1979 as 
            a performance model. The market had rested long enough. By 1982 a new Camaro 
            and Firebird were rolled out. In 1984 Chevrolet introduced a new Corvette.  
            Buick decided to shake things up with the Grand National. By 1987 the Grand 
            National had become one of the fiercest muscle cars ever. Performance was 
            back. Muscle cars continued to gradually improve all the way to the turn of 
            the century. The cars kept getting better and better and by the late 1990’s 
            these new muscle cars out did their classic muscle cars in every category.
            Performance, comfort, reliability and fuel consumption were all much better 
            than they were in the 1960s. Amazingly, no one cared. Sales were down across
            the board. GM even stopped production of the Camaro and Firebird in 2002.
